The FBI has no leadership. The Director is protecting the same gang.....that tried to........overthrow the President through an illegal coup.¡¨ (Recommended by previous DOJ) @TomFitton @JudicialWatch¡§Even Director James Clapper admits that the FBI actions against the Trump Presidential Campaign do in fact meet the definition of spying perhaps FBI Director Christopher Wray will be the next to do so.¡¨ @LouDobbsChina is DREAMING that Sleepy Joe Biden or any of the others gets elected in 2020. They LOVE ripping off America!The ¡§Constitutional Crisis¡¨ is the Democrats refusing to work. Let them start by fixing the mess that their Immigration Laws have caused at the Southern Border.When the Mueller Report came out showing NO Collusion with Russia (of course) it was supposed to be over back to work for the people. But the Dems have gone ¡§nuts¡¨ and it has actually gotten worse! Hope the Republicans win back the House in 2020 or little will get done!Ever since the Mueller Report showed No Collusion &amp; No Obstruction the Dems have been working overtime to damage me and the Republican Party by issuing over 80 demands for documents and testimonies and with NO REASON. That¡¦s all they want to do - don¡¦t care about anything else!Despite two years and millions of dollars spent the Democrats are acting like crazed lunatics ever since the results of the Mueller Report were made public. But they knew there was NOTHING even before the Report was started. It is all a big Hoax the biggest in American history!The Democrats new and pathetically untrue sound bite is that we are in a ¡§Constitutional Crisis.¡¨ They and their partner the Fake News Media are all told to say this as loud and as often as possible. They are a sad JOKE! We may have the strongest Economy in our history best.......employment numbers ever low taxes &amp; regulations a rebuilt military &amp; V.A. many great new judges &amp; so much more. But we have had a giant SCAM perpetrated upon our nation a Witch Hunt a Treasonous Hoax. That is the Constitutional Crisis &amp; hopefully guilty people will pay!We are right where we want to be with China. Remember they broke the deal with us &amp; tried to renegotiate. We will be taking in Tens of Billions of Dollars in Tariffs from China. Buyers of product can make it themselves in the USA (ideal) or buy it from non-Tariffed countries.......We will then spend (match or better) the money that China may no longer be spending with our Great Patriot Farmers (Agriculture) which is a small percentage of total Tariffs received and distribute the food to starving people in nations around the world!
