Has anyone noticed that all the Boston @RedSox have done is WIN since coming to the White House! Others also have done very well. The White House visit is becoming the opposite of being on the cover of Sports Illustrated! By the way the Boston players were GREAT guys!The unexpectedly good first quarter 3.2% GDP was greatly helped by Tariffs from China. Some people just don¡¦t get it!Also congratulations to @OANN on the great job you are doing and the big ratings jump (¡§thank you President Trump¡¨)!Thank you @foxandfriends great show this morning and congratulations on your number one (by far) rating. Well deserved!I say openly to President Xi &amp; all of my many friends in China that China will be hurt very badly if you don¡¦t make a deal because companies will be forced to leave China for other countries. Too expensive to buy in China. You had a great deal almost completed &amp; you backed out!Their is no reason for the U.S. Consumer to pay the Tariffs which take effect on China today. This has been proven recently when only 4 points were paid by the U.S. 21 points by China because China subsidizes product to such a large degree. Also the Tariffs can be.........completely avoided if you by from a non-Tariffed Country or you buy the product inside the USA (the best idea). That¡¦s Zero Tariffs. Many Tariffed companies will be leaving China for Vietnam and other such countries in Asia. That¡¦s why China wants to make a deal so badly!.....There will be nobody left in China to do business with. Very bad for China very good for USA! But China has taken so advantage of the U.S. for so many years that they are way ahead (Our Presidents did not do the job). Therefore China should not retaliate-will only get worse!¡§It¡¦s the attack strategy of harass. This is not about the Attorney General who is very sophisticated &amp; knows it isn¡¦t about him it¡¦s about trying to destroy President Trump through an assault on his AG for upholding the rule of law. He released a massive amount of......information! As long as President Trump is President his opposition will use every tool and misuse every tool available to make his life miserable.¡¨ @TomFitton @JudicialWatch @LouDobbs  Sadly this proves I am doing a great job - Also Best Economy and Employment Numbers EVER!¡§Just another abuse of power in a long series of abuses of power by the Democrats that began during the Obama Administration continued through the Mueller FBI operation &amp; now the baton has been passed to Jerry Nadler to continue to abuse power to harass President Trump......and the Democrat National Committee-The Democrat Party apparatus-has been caught using donor Dollars to Collude with Russian Intelligence to attack a domestic political opponent (me).

They LOVE ripping off America!The ¡§Constitutional Crisis¡¨ is the Democrats refusing to work. Let them start by fixing the mess that their Immigration Laws have caused at the Southern Border.When the Mueller Report came out showing NO Collusion with Russia (of course) it was supposed to be over back to work for the people. But the Dems have gone ¡§nuts¡¨ and it has actually gotten worse! Hope the Republicans win back the House in 2020 or little will get done!Ever since the Mueller Report showed No Collusion &amp; No Obstruction the Dems have been working overtime to damage me and the Republican Party by issuing over 80 demands for documents and testimonies and with NO REASON. That¡¦s all they want to do - don¡¦t care about anything else!Despite two years and millions of dollars spent the Democrats are acting like crazed lunatics ever since the results of the Mueller Report were made public. But they knew there was NOTHING even before the Report was started. It is all a big Hoax the biggest in American history!The Democrats new and pathetically untrue sound bite is that we are in a ¡§Constitutional Crisis.¡¨ They and their partner the Fake News Media are all told to say this as loud and as often as possible.

But we have had a giant SCAM perpetrated upon our nation a Witch Hunt a Treasonous Hoax. That is the Constitutional Crisis &amp; hopefully guilty people will pay!We are right where we want to be with China. Remember they broke the deal with us &amp; tried to renegotiate. We will be taking in Tens of Billions of Dollars in Tariffs from China. Buyers of product can make it themselves in the USA (ideal) or buy it from non-Tariffed countries.......We will then spend (match or better) the money that China may no longer be spending with our Great Patriot Farmers (Agriculture) which is a small percentage of total Tariffs received and distribute the food to starving people in nations around the world!
